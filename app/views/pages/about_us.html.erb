      <h3> The Team </h3>
      <p> Our team is comprised of four high school students who have each struggled through the summers to find something interesting to do.  This website was designed to make finding a summer program easy and enjoyable.  We have also made it much easier for you as a student or parent to keep track of deadlines with our personalized favorites page.  This page will allow you to keep track of all of your deadlines for applications along with the ability to prioritize certain programs based off your personal needs.  We hope you find this convenient and helpful throughout your summer college endeavors. </p>
